# NEVER BEEN SEEN

Between 2019 and 2021 the [Science Museum Group](https://www.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk) is digitising hundreds of thousands of objects from its remarkable [collection](https://www.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/about-us/collection/) as they are moved to a [new, purpose-built store in Wiltshire](https://www.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/about-us/collection/national-collections-centre/). As each of these objects are added to the [collection website](https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk), you could be the first person to see it published online though a [web page which displays objects with a total lifetime page view count of zero](https://thesciencemuseum.github.io/never-been-seen/). Find out more [about the digitisation project and Never Been Seen](https://www.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/blog/never-been-seen/).
